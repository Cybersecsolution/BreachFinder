## ðŸ”¥ Features

- **Singleton-Based Caching**  
  Employs a single-instance cache manager to store query results, minimizing redundant lookups and boosting performance.

- **JSON Cache Management**  
  Reads and writes all cached data to a JSON file, automatically purging older entries to prevent bloat and maintain quick response times.

- **Asynchronous Requests**  
  Uses a dedicated worker thread for network operations to keep the main interface responsive while performing data lookups or handling timeouts.

- **GUI with Dynamic Theming**  
  Offers both light and dark themes. Users can toggle between them on the fly, with settings saved locally for convenience.

- **Tabbed Interface**  
  Organizes content into multiple tabs (e.g., Search, Settings, About), providing a structured layout thatâ€™s easy to navigate.

- **Progress & Loading Overlay**  
  Displays an animated progress bar and an overlay during lengthy operations, offering clear visual feedback for ongoing processes.

- **Detailed Search Results**  
  Presents findings in a sortable table with multiple columns (e.g., username, phone, IP), highlighting recent or critical data in a distinct color.

- **Error Handling & Retry Logic**  
  Gracefully captures common errors (network, timeout, parsing) and prompts the user to retry or view more details when an issue occurs.

- **Breach Warnings**  
  Automatically flags and highlights any potentially severe or recent breach data, encouraging immediate user action (e.g., password changes).

- **Modular Design**  
  Employs a facade pattern to abstract and unify lookup operations, making future maintenance or enhancements simpler.

- **Unit Testing**  
  Includes basic tests to ensure core functionality (like year parsing and JSON caching) works reliably and remains stable over time.

- **Download Program**
