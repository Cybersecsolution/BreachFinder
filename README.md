## ðŸ”¥ Features

âœ… **Singleton-Based Caching**  
Employs a single-instance cache manager to store query results, minimizing redundant lookups and boosting performance.

âœ… **JSON Cache Management**  
Reads and writes all cached data to a JSON file, automatically purging older entries to prevent bloat and maintain quick response times.

âœ… **Asynchronous Requests**  
Uses a dedicated worker thread for network operations to keep the main interface responsive while performing data lookups or handling timeouts.

âœ… **GUI with Dynamic Theming**  
Offers both light and dark themes. Users can toggle between them on the fly, with settings saved locally for convenience.

âœ… **Tabbed Interface**  
Organizes content into multiple tabs (e.g., Search, Settings, About), providing a structured layout thatâ€™s easy to navigate.

âœ… **Progress & Loading Overlay**  
Displays an animated progress bar and an overlay during lengthy operations, offering clear visual feedback for ongoing processes.

âœ… **Detailed Search Results**  
Presents findings in a sortable table with multiple columns (e.g., username, phone, IP), highlighting recent or critical data in a distinct color.

âœ… **Error Handling & Retry Logic**  
Gracefully captures common errors (network, timeout, parsing) and prompts the user to retry or view more details when an issue occurs.

âœ… **Breach Warnings**  
Automatically flags and highlights any potentially severe or recent breach data, encouraging immediate user action (e.g., password changes).

âœ… **Modular Design**  
Employs a facade pattern to abstract and unify lookup operations, making future maintenance or enhancements simpler.

âœ… **Unit Testing**  
Includes basic tests to ensure core functionality (like year parsing and JSON caching) works reliably and remains stable over time.
